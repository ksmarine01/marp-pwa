# Marp PWA

This project is a small progressive web app for viewing [Marp](https://marp.app/) presentations. It runs entirely in the browser and can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static file host.

## Features

- Drag and drop a `.md`, `.marp`, or `.markdown` file to render the slides
- Navigate using buttons or keyboard arrows
- Export slides to PDF via the browser's print dialog (desktop and mobile)

## Local Development

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with any static file server, e.g.:

```bash
npx serve -s .
```

No build step or dependencies are required.
